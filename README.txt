All corpus texts are provided in the plain text file format and sorted into separate folders 
for each subcorpus. Related to the study presented in Chapter 6, each text has also been 
converted into a file with its tokens + POS tags (each on its own line) and another with 
only its POS tags.

Each numbered Worksheet refers to a separate Excel file whose individual tabs (sheets) are 
labeled with a two-digit code, where the first digit represents the number of the Worksheet
and the second digit represents the sheet’s position in the Excel file.


Worksheet 1: Corpus data

	1.1. Comparable subcorpora text list*
	1.2. Translation subcorpora text list*
	1.3. Parallel texts in corpus
	1.4. Distribution of authors in comparable subcorpora
	1.5. Distribution of authors in translation subcorpora (fixed TL)
	1.6. Distribution of translators in translation subcorpora (fixed TL)
	1.7. Data on publication dates and subcorpus sizes
	1.8. Lists of overlapping/unique authors across comparable/translation subcorpora

*In some cases, the publication years of original or translated texts were not able to be 
determined, in which case these data were excluded from sheets 1.1. and 1.2. as well as 
any subsequent calculations – e.g., the median year of publication in a subcorpus or the
corpus as a whole.


Worksheet 2: Example of TLW identification process (SV>EN)

	2.1. SV>EN translations wordlist
	2.2. Comparable Swedish wordlist
	2.3. Comparable English wordlist
	2.4. TLW candidates and confirmed TLWs*
	2.5. Overview of confirmed TLWs

*All translational loanword (TLW) candidates (types I and II) identified via the procedures 
described in Section 5.2.2. are listed in columns H and R in sheet 2.4. In order to simplify 
calculations, TLW candidates confirmed to be TLWs are listed in columns I, J, M, S, T, or W, 
depending on whether they are 1) type I or type II, 2) single-word or multi-word TLWs, 
or 3) whether instances of the same TLW occur in the same text or multiple texts.


Worksheet 3: Ch. 5 data (lexical interference)

	3.1. Frequency list of all TLWs
	3.2. TLW frequency counts
	3.3. TLW data for all translations
	3.4. TLW data for status pairs
	3.5. TLW data for language pairs
	3.6. Sizes of all fixed SL/TL subcorpora
	3.7.-3.13. TLW data for each fixed TL subcorpus
	3.14.-3.20. TLW data for each fixed SL subcorpus

Worksheet 4: Example of SINC calculations (FR>IT I tre moschettieri vol I)

	4.1. Overview of SINC scores for the translation
	4.2. Calculations for POS 1-grams

	4.4. Calculations for POS 3-grams
	4.5. Calculations for POS 4-grams

	5.1. SINC score descriptive statistics
	5.2. SINC data for all translations
	5.3. Language status differential hypothesis comparisons
	5.4.-5.10. SINC data for each fixed TL subcorpus
	5.11.-5.17. SINC data for each fixed SL subcorpus

	6.6. Footnotes/TFNs in Swedish translations
	6.7. Footnotes/TFNs in Croatian translations
	6.8. Footnotes/TFNs in Irish translations

Worksheet 7: Ch. 7 data (paratextual foreignization)

	7.1. TFN data for all translations
